# Winter04 Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
Code must adhere to established coding standards and guidelines. All code must be reviewed for readability, maintainability, and adherence to project conventions. Automated linters and formatters must be used to enforce consistency.

### Testing Standards
All code must be accompanied by automated tests. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests must be implemented as appropriate. Test coverage must meet or exceed 90%, and all tests must pass before merging.

### User Experience Consistency
The user experience must be intuitive, accessible, and consistent across all platforms. Design decisions must prioritize user needs and follow established UX/UI guidelines. Regular user testing and feedback loops are mandatory.

## Additional Constraints

### Security Requirements
All code must be reviewed for security vulnerabilities. Dependencies must be regularly audited, and sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

## Development Workflow

### Review Process
All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member. Reviews must ensure compliance with the principles outlined in this constitution.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
