# Feature Specification: Retirement Calculator Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-retirement`  
**Created**: 8 October 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a retirement calculator application that helps users project their retirement savings and visualize growth over time. Users can input parameters such as current age, retirement age, current savings, monthly contributions, annual return rate, inflation rate, and tax rate. The application provides real-time validation, displays results in a table with yearly breakdowns, and includes an interactive growth chart. It adjusts calculations for inflation and tax, and calculates the annualized real return. The interface is accessible, styled with a dark theme, and includes sample data autofill for quick testing."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Input Parameters and Projection (Priority: P1)

Users can input their current age, retirement age, current savings, monthly contributions, annual return rate, inflation rate, and tax rate to project their retirement savings.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application, enabling users to calculate their retirement savings.

**Independent Test**: Ensure users can input all parameters and receive a projection without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user inputs valid parameters, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system displays a projection of retirement savings.
2. **Given** the user inputs invalid parameters, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system displays appropriate validation messages.

### User Story 2 - Visualization of Growth (Priority: P2)

Users can view an interactive growth chart and a table with yearly breakdowns of their retirement savings.

**Why this priority**: Visualization enhances user understanding and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Ensure the chart and table update dynamically based on user inputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user inputs valid parameters, **When** they view the results, **Then** the system displays an interactive growth chart and a yearly breakdown table.
2. **Given** the user modifies parameters, **When** they view the results, **Then** the chart and table update in real-time.

---

### User Story 3 - Accessibility and Dark Theme (Priority: P3)

The interface is accessible and styled with a dark theme.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility ensures inclusivity, and the dark theme aligns with modern UI preferences.

**Independent Test**: Verify compliance with accessibility standards and proper dark theme styling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with accessibility needs, **When** they use the application, **Then** the system meets accessibility standards.
2. **Given** the user enables dark mode, **When** they interact with the application, **Then** the system displays the dark theme correctly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user inputs extreme values (e.g., very high or low contributions)?
  - Extreme values will be capped to predefined limits to ensure realistic projections.
- How does the system handle missing or incomplete inputs?
  - The system will prompt users to complete missing fields before proceeding.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input current age, retirement age, current savings, monthly contributions, annual return rate, inflation rate, and tax rate.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate user inputs in real-time and display appropriate error messages by highlighting invalid fields.
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate retirement savings projections, adjusting for inflation and tax, and compute the annualized real return using a formula that accounts for compounding (e.g., Fisher equation).
- **FR-004**: System MUST display results in a table with yearly breakdowns and an interactive growth chart.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an accessible interface styled with a dark theme.
- **FR-006**: System MUST include a sample data autofill feature for quick testing, providing a button to autofill fields on demand.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User Input**: Represents parameters such as age, savings, contributions, and rates.
- **Projection Data**: Represents calculated yearly savings, adjusted for inflation and tax.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can input parameters and generate projections within 2 minutes.
- **SC-002**: System handles 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete a projection on their first attempt.
- **SC-004**: User satisfaction score for the interface is 90% or higher.
