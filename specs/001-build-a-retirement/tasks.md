## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Input Parameters and Projection (Priority: P1)



### T004: Create Input Form [X]
- **Description**: Develop a form for users to input parameters.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a React component for the input form.
  2. Add fields for current age, retirement age, current savings, monthly contributions, annual return rate, inflation rate, and tax rate.
  3. Implement real-time validation for each field.
- **Output**: Functional input form with validation.

### T005: Implement Projection Logic [X]
- **Description**: Develop the logic to calculate retirement savings projections.
- **Steps**:
  1. Write a function to calculate projections, adjusting for inflation and tax.
  2. Use the Fisher equation for annualized real return.
  3. Write unit tests for the projection logic.
- **Output**: Projection logic implemented and tested.

### T006: Add hot reload dev server
+ **Description**: Add a dev server the user can view [X]
+ **Steps**:
  1. Install and configure Webpack Dev Server.
  2. Update `package.json` to add a `start` script:  
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "webpack serve --port 9876 --hot"
     }
     ```
  3. Ensure Webpack config enables hot module replacement.
  4. Document usage: run `npm run start` to launch the dev server on port 9876.
+ **Output**: The user use start a dev server with hot reload.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Visualization of Growth (Priority: P2)

### T006: Develop Growth Chart [X]
**Description**: Create an interactive growth chart.
**Steps**:
  1. Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to create the chart.
  2. Bind the chart to the projection data.
  3. Ensure the chart updates dynamically based on user inputs.
**Output**: Interactive growth chart.

### T007: Create Yearly Breakdown Table [X]
**Description**: Develop a table to display yearly breakdowns of retirement savings.
**Steps**:
  1. Create a React component for the table.
  2. Populate the table with projection data.
  3. Ensure the table updates dynamically based on user inputs.
**Output**: Yearly breakdown table.

### T008: Add calculate button [X]
- **Description**: Add a button to trigger retirement projection calculations.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a React button component labeled "Calculate".
  2. Connect the button to the projection logic so it runs when clicked.
  3. Disable the button if input validation fails.
  4. Show a loading indicator while calculations are running.
- **Output**: Calculate button that triggers projections and provides user feedback.

### T008b: Improve Test Coverage [X]
- **Description**: Increase test coverage to meet the 80% threshold for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify untested code paths, especially in InputForm.js and other low-coverage files.
  2. Write additional unit and integration tests to cover missing branches, statements, and functions.
  3. Run tests and verify coverage meets or exceeds 80% for all metrics.
- **Output**: Test suite passes with at least 80% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines.

### T009: Add "Fill Sample Data" Button [X]
- **Description**: Add a button to populate the input form with sample data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a button labelled "Fill Sample Data".
  2. Implement logic to fill all input fields with realistic sample values.
  3. Add a tooltip explaining the purpose of the button.
- **Output**: Button that quickly fills the form with sample data for testing.

### T010: Step Values for Numeric Inputs
- **Description**: Set appropriate step values for all numeric input fields in the form to improve usability.
- **Steps**:
  1. Update the input components to use the specified step values.
    - **Current Age**: Step = 1 year  
    - **Retirement Age**: Step = 1 year  
    - **Current Savings**: Step = $5,000  
    - **Monthly Contributions**: Step = $100  
    - **Annual Return Rate**: Step = 0.5%  
    - **Inflation Rate**: Step = 0.5%  
    - **Tax Rate**: Step = 0.5%  
  2. Ensure step values are reflected in the UI and validation logic.
  3. Test each input to confirm correct increment/decrement behavior.
- **Output**: Numeric inputs with user-friendly step values.
