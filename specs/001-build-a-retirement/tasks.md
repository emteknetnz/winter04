## Task List

### T007: Remove Inflation from Inputs, Calculations, and Outputs [X]

- **Description**: Eliminate all references to inflation from the retirement calculator, including input fields, calculation logic, and displayed results.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify and remove any inflation-related input fields from the UI.
  2. Update calculation logic to exclude inflation adjustments.
  3. Remove inflation references from output displays, charts, and tables.
  4. Refactor documentation and help text to reflect the absence of inflation.
  5. Test the application to ensure calculations and projections are correct without inflation.
- **Output**: Inflation removed from all inputs, calculations, and outputs; application reflects the change.

### T012: Validate Retirement Calculator Calculations [X]

- **Description**: Confirm that all calculations performed by the retirement calculator are accurate and reflect the latest requirements, including recent changes (e.g., removal of inflation and starting balance).
- **Steps**:
