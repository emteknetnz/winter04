### T006: Remove Year Column from Table [ ]

- **Description**: The "Year" column in the projection table is redundant since the "Age" column already provides the necessary information. Remove the "Year" column to simplify the table.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify the table component and locate the "Year" column definition.
  2. Remove the "Year" column from the table layout and data source.
  3. Ensure the table displays correctly without the "Year" column.
  4. Test the table to confirm that all remaining columns and data are accurate.
- **Output**: "Year" column removed from the projection table; table displays only relevant columns.
