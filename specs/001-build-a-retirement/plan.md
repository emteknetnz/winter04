# Implementation Plan: Retirement Calculator Application

**Branch**: `001-build-a-retirement` | **Date**: 8 October 2025 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-retirement/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a retirement calculator application that helps users project their retirement savings and visualize growth over time. Users can input parameters such as current age, retirement age, current savings, monthly contributions, annual return rate, inflation rate, and tax rate. The application provides real-time validation, displays results in a table with yearly breakdowns, and includes an interactive growth chart. It adjusts calculations for inflation and tax, and calculates the annualized real return. The interface is accessible, styled with a dark theme, and includes sample data autofill for quick testing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Webpack, Jest, React Testing Library  
**Storage**: IndexedDB (local browser storage)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (WCAG AA compliance)  
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: Real-time validation and updates  
**Constraints**: Mobile-first design, responsive, accessible (WCAG AA), dark theme  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page application with interactive charts and tables

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Code Quality**: Ensure adherence to Airbnb's JavaScript style guide and use Prettier for formatting.
- **Testing Standards**: Implement unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library. Achieve 90%+ test coverage.
- **User Experience Consistency**: Follow BEM conventions for SCSS styling. Ensure accessibility (WCAG AA) and responsive design.
- **Review Process**: All pull requests must be reviewed for compliance with these principles.

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
